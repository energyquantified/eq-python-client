"""
Extract the most recent forecast for each hour, up-to one hour in advanced.

This is useful for intraday benchmarking.

The script will give you a pandas.DataFrame with the values at the end. It
prints this for demonstration purposes.

Usage:

 1. Install dependencies:
    pip install --upgrade energyquantified
    pip install pandas

 2. Add API key below: eq = EnergyQuantified(api_key='...')

 3. Change options (line 41-47). You should update the begin and the end
    datetime in particular.

 4. Run script


---

Note: This script may take some time to run, as it loads the forecasts
from one day at a time in a loop. If you need to check day-ahead forecasts,
you would be better off using relative(). See the documentation for more info:

https://energyquantified-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/instances.html#relative-queries-day-ahead-forecasts
