# Energy Quantified Python Client

The Python library for [Energy Quantified](https://www.energyquantified.com)'s
Time Series API. It allows you to access thousands of data series directly from
Energy Quantified's time series database. It integrates with the popular
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) library for high-performance data
analysis and manipulation.

Developed for **Python 3.7+**.

**Note:** An user account with an API key is required to use this library.

## Example usage

How to initialize the client, search for data series and download data.
More details available in the
[documentation](https://energyquantified-python.readthedocs.io).

```python
from datetime import date, timedelta
from energyquantified import EnergyQuantified

# Initialize client
eq = EnergyQuantified(api_key='<insert api key here>')

# Freetext search (filtering on attributes is also supported)
curves = eq.metadata.curves(q='germany wind production actual')

# Load time series data
curve = curve[0]
timeseries = eq.timeseries.load(
    curve,
    begin=date.today() - timedelta(days=10),
    end=date.today()
)

# Convert to Pandas data frame
df = timeseries.to_dataframe()
```
