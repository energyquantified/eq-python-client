The Python library for [Energy Quantified](https://www.energyquantified.com)'s
Time Series API. It allows you to access thousands of data series directly from
Energy Quantified's time series database. It integrates with the popular
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) library for high-performance data
analysis and manipulation.

Developed for **Python 3.7+**.

```python
from datetime import date, timedelta
from energyquantified import EnergyQuantified

# Initialize client
eq = EnergyQuantified(api_key='<insert api key here>')

# Freetext search (filtering on attributes is also supported)
curves = eq.metadata.curves(q='de wind production actual')

# Load time series data
curve = curves[0]
timeseries = eq.timeseries.load(
    curve,
    begin=date.today() - timedelta(days=10),
    end=date.today()
)

# Convert to Pandas data frame
df = timeseries.to_dataframe()
```
