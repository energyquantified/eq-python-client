The official Python library for `Energy Quantified <https://www.energyquantified.com>`_'s
Time Series API. It allows you to access thousands of data series directly from
Energy Quantified's time series database. It integrates with the popular
`pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/>`_ library for high-performance data
analysis and manipulation.

Developed for **Python 3.7+**.

.. code-block:: python

   from datetime import date, timedelta
   from energyquantified import EnergyQuantified

   # Initialize client
   eq = EnergyQuantified(api_key='<insert api key here>')

   # Free-text search (filtering on attributes is also supported)
   curves = eq.metadata.curves(q='de wind production actual')

   # Load time series data
   curve = curves[0]
   timeseries = eq.timeseries.load(
       curve,
       begin=date.today() - timedelta(days=10),
       end=date.today()
   )

   # Convert to Pandas data frame
   df = timeseries.to_dataframe()
